                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p><strong>Mahendra Mahat — Lead Trainer &amp; Founder</strong><br>
                E-RYT 500 | Sound Healing Master | Yoga Philosophy &amp; Meditation Specialist</p>
                <p>Mahendra Mahat brings a rare depth of wisdom to every training and healing session, rooted in his rich spiritual lineage and lifelong dedication to the yogic path. Born in Nepal into a unique family tradition—his father a respected shamanic healer and his mother a Brahmin from a priestly caste—Mahendra was immersed in sacred rituals and spiritual practices from an early age.</p>

                <p>Over the past 18 years, Mahendra has been teaching yoga, meditation, and Himalayan sound bowl healing across Nepal, India, Thailand, Bali, Sri Lanka, Germany, and Switzerland. His teaching style is grounded, compassionate, and deeply transformative, blending the traditional yogic sciences with Buddhist philosophy, shamanic energy work, and sound therapy.</p>

                <p>Mahendra's studies have taken him on a remarkable journey through some of the most respected spiritual centers of Asia:</p>
                <ul class="benefits-list">
                    <li>Long-term ashram training in Rishikesh and Varanasi (Banaras), India, where he mastered classical Hatha Yoga, Sanskrit texts, and the deeper dimensions of yogic philosophy.</li>
                    <li>Extended retreat in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Mustang, Nepal, where he explored Vajrayana teachings, meditation, and the integration of mindfulness with yoga.</li>
                    <li>Initiations and healing ceremonies within his native shamanic tradition, learning the vibrational principles that later informed his mastery of Himalayan sound bowls.</li>
                    <li>Formal academic degree in Yoga from a recognized Nepali public university, combining scriptural study with modern yoga education.</li>
                    <li>Certified as a Yoga Alliance 500-hour (RYT-500) instructor, recognized internationally as a senior-level teacher and mentor.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>As the founder and lead trainer of Atma Jyoti Yoga Retreat &amp; Sound Healing Center, Mahendra now shares his integrated path through the Yoga Alliance Certified 200-hour and 300-hour Teacher Training Courses, as well as through healing workshops, sound therapy certifications, and advanced retreats.</p>

                <h3>Team at Atma Jyoti – A Collaborative Vision for Holistic Healing</h3>
